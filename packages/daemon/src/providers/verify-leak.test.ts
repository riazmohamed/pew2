/**
 * A health check must not leave the patient running.

 * is the only way to know — but it means setup's failure modes are *processes*,
 * not just wrong words on a screen.
 *
 * Two clocks used to own the same child. `verifyProvider` gave up after its own
 * timeout and returned, while `connectProvider` — which owns the process and is
 * the only thing that can kill it — was still waiting on a much longer budget
 * for a child nobody would ever collect. Every agent that answered the handshake
 * and then stalled left a live process behind, one per agent per run of setup,
 * until the machine was rebooted.
 *
 * These spawn real processes and count them, because that is the only assertion
 * that would have caught it.
