/**
 * `pew2 pair` — the one screen a new user sees before anything works.
 *
 * It does three things the old version did not, in ascending order of how much
 * support time they save:
 *
 *   1. It *verifies* rather than asserts. "Works from anywhere" is printed only
 *      after the relay has answered a health check, because a confident status
 *      line next to a dead relay sends the user to debug their phone.
 *   2. It waits, and says so. The moment a device attaches — over the LAN or
 *      through the relay, on the far side of the world — the spinner resolves
 *      into a confirmation. "Did that work?" is the question this command
 *      existed to leave unanswered.
 *   3. It stays useful when it is not a terminal. `--json` is unchanged, the
 *      animation degrades to plain lines, and every colour and glyph is
 *      decoration over words that already say the same thing.
 *
 * Waiting is not required for pairing to succeed: the QR is valid the instant
 * it is printed, and `--no-wait` or Ctrl-C leaves it that way.

 * than judging whether they need it.
 *
 * This used to reason about the stored claim, and every branch of that reasoning
 * had a way to strand somebody. A claimed pairing rotated, which was right. An
 * unclaimed one printed as it stood, to protect a QR being scanned mid-walk —
 * but the commonest reason a pairing looks unclaimed is that the last attempt
 * half-failed, and reprinting the code the phone already refused is a loop with
 * no exit. A pre-gate `phone` placeholder also printed as-is, so anyone on an
 * older app got the dead code twice. `--rotate` existed to escape all of it,
 * which is the tell: a flag whose purpose is making the command do the thing
 * people already meant by running it.
 *
 * Rotating every time costs a QR that is being scanned at this exact moment —
 * rare, caused by running the command twice, and fixed by scanning the new one
 * already on screen. Not rotating cost people the ability to connect at all.
 *
 * `--rotate` is still accepted, so muscle memory and every README line keep
 * working; it simply no longer decides anything.
