/**
 * The test script must actually reach every test.
 *
 * `bun test` cannot be pointed at the repo root here: scanning a tree this wide
 * exhausts file descriptors and spawned agents come back with empty pipes and a
 * success code (the `//test` note in the root `package.json` has the detail). So
 * the script names one source root per package instead — which buys a correct
 * suite at the cost of a list that can fall behind the packages it covers.
 *
 * A missing root is silent in the worst way: `bun test` reports every test it
 * ran as passing, and a new package's tests simply are not among them. Nobody
 * reads a green run and goes looking for the tests that did not appear in it.
 *
 * So the roots are read back out of the script rather than restated here. A copy
 * of the list in this file would be one more thing to forget to update, and it
 * would agree with itself while disagreeing with what CI runs.
 *
 * The one gap this cannot close is its own: a check that lives inside the suite
 * cannot notice that it was never run. Drop the root covering this file and both
 * tests below vanish silently, along with everything else under it. The second
 * test narrows that to the case worth catching — this file moved out from under
 * the roots while still being run — but what it ultimately rests on is CI
 * invoking `bun run test` rather than a path of its own.
