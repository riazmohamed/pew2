/**
 * Diagnosis as data.
 *
 * This is the contract that makes one-command setup work when a coding agent is
 * driving it: every problem carries a stable `id`, a human `detail`, and a `fix`
 * that is either a shell command or a precise instruction. The agent runs the
 * fix, runs `doctor` again, and stops when `ok` is true. Prose in console output
 * cannot support that loop; a machine-readable problem list can.
 *
 * `ok` is deliberately about *blocking* problems only. A missing optional API
 * key on an agent that has its own login flow is a warning, not a failure, and
 * must not trap an agent in a loop it cannot escape.
