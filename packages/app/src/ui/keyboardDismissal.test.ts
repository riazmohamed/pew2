/**
 * Which overlays take the keyboard down, and which deliberately do not.
 *
 * There is no renderer in this suite, so these read the source. That is enough,
 * because the rule being protected is a decision about *where the call lives*,
 * not about what it computes — and the decision is not obvious enough to survive
 * on comments alone.
 *
 * The rule: an overlay that rests against the bottom edge dismisses the
 * keyboard, because that is exactly where the keyboard is and the card would
 * otherwise open behind it. An overlay anchored to a control at the top does
 * not, because switching a setting mid-sentence should not drop the draft's
 * keyboard and bounce the composer.
