# identical pipeline here, costs nothing, and takes about three minutes. That is
# the whole reason this script exists — everything else it does is bookkeeping
# around one command.

# It is *not* the same as `release-to-device.sh` beside it. That one signs with
# the development certificate to reproduce Release behaviour on a phone you have
# plugged in; the result cannot be uploaded. This produces a distribution-signed
# archive Apple will accept.
