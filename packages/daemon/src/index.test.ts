/**
 * Daemon behaviour that only shows up in ordering.

 * **Session liveness.** A resumed agent replays its history *during*
 * `session/load`, before the handler can announce the session. Clients drop
 * events for sessions they have not been told about, so those early events must
 * be held in the log and flushed only after `session.started` — the bug this
 * guards rendered every resumed GG Coder conversation empty on the phone.
 *
 * **Config preferences.** A model or mode is a property of a session, but the
 * user picks one in the empty state, where no session exists yet. The choice is
 * therefore stored against the provider and applied when the session opens.
