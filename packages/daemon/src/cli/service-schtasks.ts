/**
 * Keeping the daemon alive on Windows, via a Scheduled Task.
 *
 * Windows has a real service manager, and it is the wrong tool here: a true
 * service needs Administrator to register, runs in session 0, and would spawn
 * every coding agent outside the user's desktop session and away from their
 * environment. Task Scheduler registers per-user with no elevation, which is
 * what an install script run from an ordinary shell can actually do.
 *
 * ## How a task becomes a keepalive
 *
 * Task Scheduler has no `KeepAlive`. `RestartOnFailure` is not it either: that
 * fires when an action *fails*, and the self-updater ends the daemon with exit
 * 0, which is a success. Under that setting an update would swap the binary,
 * exit cleanly, and never come back.
 *
 * So the restart is built from two settings that do apply, and the combination
 * is the whole trick:
 *
 * - a **logon trigger with a repetition** of one minute, so Windows attempts to
 *   start the task continuously, for ever; and
 * - **`MultipleInstancesPolicy: IgnoreNew`**, which does not start a new
 *   instance while one is already running.
 *
 * Together they mean: while the daemon is up, every attempt is ignored; the
 * moment it exits, the next attempt starts it. That is a poll rather than a
 * supervisor, so the worst-case gap is the repetition interval — a minute,
 * against launchd's ten-second throttle. Acceptable for an update restart, and
 * the reason `update/scheduler.ts` only ever exits when the daemon is idle.
 *
 * `ExecutionTimeLimit: PT0S` disables the three-day default kill, which would
 * otherwise terminate a long-lived daemon on a schedule.
