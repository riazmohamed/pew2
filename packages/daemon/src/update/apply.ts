/**
 * Replace this machine's `pew2` binary with a newly published one.
 *
 * Step two of self-update: download, verify, swap. It still does not restart
 * anything — the running process keeps executing the old inode until something
 * ends it, which is deliberate and is the whole reason the swap is safe to do
 * while the daemon is serving a phone.
 *
 * ## Why a rename, and why beside the target
 *
 * `rename(2)` is atomic within a filesystem: the directory entry points at the
 * old inode or the new one, never at half a file. A reader that opened the old
 * binary keeps it — which is what lets a running daemon be replaced under
 * itself instead of crashing on a truncated executable. Writing in place would
 * do exactly that, and on macOS is refused outright for a running image.
 *
 * Atomicity stops at the filesystem boundary, so the staging file is created in
 * the *install directory*, not in `os.tmpdir()`. A temp dir is routinely a
 * different volume (and under `scripts/test-setup.ts` it is a different one
 * again), where `rename` fails with EXDEV and the fallback everyone reaches for
 * — copy then delete — is the non-atomic operation this is avoiding.
 *
 * ## Two hard gates, both about not destroying a working machine
 *
 * **darwin only.** Replacing the binary is only half an update; the process has
 * to end for it to take effect, and ending it is only survivable where a
 * supervisor brings it back. Only macOS has one: `cli/service.ts` installs a
 * launchd plist with `KeepAlive: true`. `install.ps1` registers no Windows
 * service and no scheduled task, and no systemd unit is written anywhere in
 * this repository. Swapping the binary on those platforms would leave the user
 * with a new file, an old process, and no way to close the gap except by hand.
 *
 * **Compiled builds only.** `process.execPath` is the running executable, which
 * for a released install is `pew2` — but under `bun run packages/daemon/src/
 * server.ts` it is the developer's **`bun` binary**. Renaming a 60MB pew2 build
 * over `~/.bun/bin/bun` would replace the runtime every other project on that
 * machine depends on, from a background timer, with no prompt. `isCompiled()`
 * is the same check `service.ts` uses to decide what to put in the plist, and
 * it is what keeps this module inert in development.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. Every outcome is a value, because the eventual caller is
 * a timer inside a daemon holding someone's session, and an exception there
 * costs far more than a skipped update.
