/**
 * Message composer, with two states and a continuous transition between them.
 *
 * Resting: a single 58pt pill — attach, text, voice — all on one line, so an
 * idle screen shows one calm control rather than a tall empty box.
 *
 * Focused (or once text is entered): the text region lifts to its own full-width
 * row above the action row. This is what stops a long draft from ever clipping
 * or overlapping the attach and send buttons in the lower corners.
 *
 * The two states are one layout, not two trees. The action row is always
 * anchored to the bottom 58pt — which *is* the whole pill when collapsed — so
 * the buttons never move, and only the text region animates. That also keeps the
 * TextInput mounted throughout, so focus is never dropped mid-transition.
 *
 * Metrics and colours are sampled from the reference build: 36pt buttons inset
 * 11pt from the pill edge, #e0e0e0 glyphs, #828282 placeholder.
