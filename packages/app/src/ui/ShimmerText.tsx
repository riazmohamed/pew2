/**
 * Text lit by a gradient travelling across the glyphs.
 *
 * A gradient cannot be a text style, so the text is used as a *mask* and the
 * colour is painted underneath: a solid base for what the word is at rest, and
 * a moving highlight that lifts it as it passes. Masking means only the glyphs
 * are lit — a gradient laid over the row would light the gaps between letters
 * and read as a bar sliding past.
 *
 * Two users, two rhythms. The composer's `/command` pulses (a sweep, then a
 * pause) because it is punctuation on a static badge; the activity line sweeps
 * continuously because it is the app's proof that something is still happening
 * on a machine the user cannot see.
