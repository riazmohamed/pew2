/**
 * Dev-only visual harness for the Composer's states.
 *
 * Focus is hard to drive deterministically from a script, so these render side
 * by side using only the component's public API: an empty composer rests
 * collapsed, one holding text stays expanded, a draft past the eight-line
 * ceiling shows where growth stops, attachments add a chip row, and dictation
 * lights the mic. Each sits in a fixed-height slot so a screenshot can be
 * measured against known coordinates.
 *
 * Not reachable from the app. Rendered by temporarily pointing index.ts here,
 * and it runs on web (`npx expo start --web`) — which is why anything iOS-only
 * inside the tree has to be optional-called rather than assumed.
