/**
 * "New chat" — where?
 *
 * The button used to start a conversation the instant it was tapped, which
 * meant a new chat always landed wherever the agent happened to be. That is the
 * right guess most of the time and unfixable from the phone the rest of it: the
 * only way to work in another repo was to walk back to the desk.
 *
 * So it asks, in one tap either way. The first step names the project you are
 * already in, because continuing here is the common case and it should not cost
 * a list. The second step is that list, for the times it is not.
 *
 * A sheet rather than the drawer's dropdown: this is a decision that starts
 * something, taken from the conversation, and it belongs on the same bottom
 * edge as commands and approvals rather than behind a menu in another panel.
 *
 * There is a third step, and it is the one that makes a new agent usable at all.
 * The project list is folded from an agent's *own* past sessions, so an agent
 * installed five minutes ago offers nothing: no projects, no way to start, and
 * no way out of that state from the phone. Browsing asks the desktop what is on
 * its disk — suggested git checkouts first, then any directory — which is the
 * only thing that breaks that loop.
 *
 * The steps are a **push**, not a swap: each pane arrives from the right as the
 * one before it leaves to the left, and the card resizes under them. Every step
 * stays mounted so none has to be rebuilt mid-travel, and the hidden ones are
 * inert. A cut between two cards of different heights reads as the sheet
 * flinching; this reads as one object with somewhere to go.
