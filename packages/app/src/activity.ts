 * What the agent is doing right now, and what it did once the turn is over.

 * parse React Native's Flow syntax, and this is the file where the rules worth
 * testing live. `ui/ActivityLine.tsx` and `ui/TurnReceipt.tsx` only draw it.
 *
 * ACP reports every tool the model invokes as a `tool_call` and then revises it
 * with `tool_call_update`s, so a turn is a stream of small status changes that
 * nothing in this app used to render. Folding them into one "current tool" is
 * what turns that stream into a single live line, and counting them is what
 * lets the finished turn state what it actually did instead of vanishing.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented: the duration is measured on this device, the tool
 * count is what the agent reported, and tokens are shown *only* when the agent
 * sent a usage figure of its own.
