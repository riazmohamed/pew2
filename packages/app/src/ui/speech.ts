/**
 * Turning speech into composer text.
 *
 * Binds `expo-speech-recognition` (iOS `SFSpeechRecognizer`, Android
 * `SpeechRecognizer`); the merge rule and the wording of failures live in the
 * Expo-free `../transcription`, which is what `bun test` can actually load.
 *
 * The module is required **lazily inside a `try`** on purpose. It is a native
 * module, so it does not exist in Expo Go — and the project's live-reload loop
 * runs there. A top-level import would turn "dictation is unavailable" into a
 * red screen on launch that takes the whole app down with it. Instead
 * `speechAvailable()` answers false and the composer simply has no mic button.
 *
 * The `try` is not enough on its own, though. Expo Go *logs* the failure with
 * `console.error` on its way to throwing, and in dev that is a LogBox error
 * screen — indistinguishable from a real crash, and it was read as one. So the
 * native side is probed with `requireOptionalNativeModule` first, which answers
 * null instead of throwing, and the package's JS entry point (which resolves
 * the native module at import time) is only reached when there is something to
 * resolve. Expo Go now says nothing at all.
