/**
 * End-to-end encryption between the phone and the daemon.
 *
 * The relay's job is to route and to order; it has never needed to *read*
 * anything. Until now it could, because the pairing token was handed to it as
 * the room key — the same secret that authorised driving every agent on the
 * machine. This module separates those two jobs:
 *
 *   - the relay is given a **room id**, derived one-way from the root key, and
 *     is therefore incapable of deriving the key back;
 *   - message content is sealed with keys the relay never sees.
 *
 * It also changes what authentication *is*. A bearer token is proved by
 * repeating it, so anyone who overhears it can repeat it too. A key is proved by
 * producing a frame that authenticates under it, which an eavesdropper cannot do
 * from having seen the room id.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and dependency-light on purpose. The same code runs in
 * Node (daemon), Hermes (phone) and workerd (relay), and three implementations
 * that agree in tests but differ in a corner is exactly how encryption fails
 * silently. React Native has no `crypto.subtle`, so a pure-JS implementation is
 * not a preference — it is the only option that is identical everywhere.
