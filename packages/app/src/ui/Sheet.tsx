/**
 * The one bottom sheet every modal in this app is made of.
 *
 * Commands, an agent's thinking, and an approval request are all "a titled card
 * arriving from the bottom edge", so they share this chrome exactly: same
 * travel, same spring, same grabber, same header, same card height. Three
 * hand-rolled copies would drift the moment one of them was tuned.
 *
 * `onClose` is optional on purpose. A sheet the user opened is dismissed by the
 * scrim, the grabber, or the close button; an approval request is *not* — the
 * agent is blocked on an answer, and a stray tap that dismissed it would strand
 * the turn with no way back.
 *
 * A sheet with steps changes its own title and swaps close for back as it goes.
 * Both cross-fade, because the content underneath them is travelling: a header
 * that cuts while the panes slide is the one part of the movement that gives
 * away there were two cards all along.
 *
 * ## Why every value here lives on the UI thread
 *
 * This used to be legacy `Animated` with the travel distance held in React
 * state. Opening cost three commits of the whole app tree before a single pixel
 * moved — render to mount, render to measure, render to animate — and that dead
 * air between the finger leaving the glass and the card starting to move is
 * exactly what read as "not smooth". UIKit starts a sheet's transition on the
 * same frame as the touch.
 *
 * So: one commit, and everything after it is Reanimated. The card is present in
 * the same render that flips `visible`, its measured height goes into a shared
 * value rather than state (no re-render), and the spring runs on the UI thread
 * where React cannot starve it. What is left is a single layout pass — which is
 * what the platform spends too.
