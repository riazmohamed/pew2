/**
 * Which project the drawer is showing, and which one a new conversation opens
 * in.
 *
 * The history list is a recent-work switcher: the newest conversations across
 * everything this agent has done. That answers "what was I just doing" and
 * nothing else — a repo touched last month has no rows in it at all, so there
 * was no way to say "work on *that* one" without going back to the desk. The
 * project selector is that missing axis, and it does two jobs at once: it
 * narrows the list, and it decides where the next session starts.
 *
 * The daemon folds projects from the agent's *whole* session list, which is
 * why they arrive separately from `sessions` rather than being grouped from
 * it here. This module still derives them from whatever sessions it can see,
 * as a fallback for an older daemon and so a project used seconds ago appears
 * before the next probe lands.
 *
 * Pure and react-free: the matching rules below are the fiddly part and are
 * directly testable.

 * dependency, that made `projectsForProvider` rebuild its Map and run a
 * `localeCompare` sort on every chunk, for a drawer that is usually closed and
 * whose contents had not changed.
 *
 * This is that list reduced to what the function above actually reads: `cwd`
 * and `startedAt`, over the sessions belonging to this agent. Building it is a
 * linear pass over values already in memory, cheaper than the sort it now
 * nearly always avoids — and it is exact rather than a heuristic: if this
 * string is unchanged, so is the list it would have produced. It errs toward
 * including a session the caller later discards, never toward omitting one.
 *
