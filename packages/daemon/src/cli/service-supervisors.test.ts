/**
 * The Linux and Windows supervisors.
 *
 * What is actually being tested is one property, stated three different ways on
 * three platforms: **the daemon comes back after a clean exit**. Self-update
 * swaps the binary and then ends the process with status 0, so a supervisor
 * that only restarts on failure — which is the default advice on both platforms
 * — would leave the user with a new binary and no daemon.
 *
 * Text assertions on generated config, because that config is the contract with
 * an OS that is not this one. `bun test` runs on macOS here, so the unit file
 * and task XML cannot be executed; what can be checked is that the settings
 * which decide the behaviour are present and correct.
