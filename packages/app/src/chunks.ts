/**
 * Pulling display text out of ACP `session/update` payloads.
 *
 * Pure and React-free so the role mapping is directly testable — the same
 * split as `pairingLink.ts`, and for the same reason: `bun test` cannot parse
 * React Native's Flow syntax.
 *
 * The role mapping is where a replayed conversation's shape is decided. GG
 * Coder replays user messages as `user_message_chunk`; leaving that unmapped
 * dropped every user turn, which let consecutive agent chunks coalesce into
 * one giant bubble — a resumed thread read as a single wall of agent text.
 *
 * A chunk carries images as well as text, because ACP content is not only text:
 * an agent that generates or reads a picture sends an `image` block, a
 * `resource_link`, or tool-call content. Text-only extraction is why those
 * arrived as nothing at all.
