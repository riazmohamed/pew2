/**
 * What the finished turn cost, in one quiet line under the answer.
 *
 * The live activity line exits when the turn ends, which would otherwise leave
 * no trace of work that took minutes. This is that trace: a receipt, not a
 * status. Faint, static, and it never competes with the reply above it.
 *
 * Everything in it is measured or reported — the duration by this device, the
 * tool count by the agent, tokens only when the agent volunteered a figure.
 * It is replaced by the activity line again the moment the next prompt is sent.
