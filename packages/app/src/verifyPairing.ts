/**
 * Prove a pairing works before the app commits to it.
 *
 * A scanned link only ever had its *shape* checked: the right host, a token of
 * the right length, a key that decodes. None of that says the credential is
 * live. A retired token parses exactly as well as a current one, so the app
 * stored it, moved to the main screen, and sat on "Connecting to your
 * machine..." forever — the one state that looks like a slow network and is
 * actually permanent.
 *
 * The transport cannot tell the user this on its own. Both refusals happen
 * before a WebSocket exists: the daemon answers 401 on the LAN, and the relay
 * answers 409 for a room with no daemon in it, which is precisely the room a
 * rotated token names. There is no open socket to carry an explanation down, so
 * the app has to find out by trying.
 *
 * So: connect, prove, and require a sealed answer. A frame this device can
 * decrypt is the only evidence that means anything — it says the machine is
 * reachable, that it accepted this device, and that both ends hold the same
 * key. Anything less is a guess.

 *
 * Above Android's 10 second per-address connect timeout on purpose. At 8s, a
