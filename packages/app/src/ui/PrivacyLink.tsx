/**
 * The privacy policy, reachable from inside the app.

 * App Review asks for this in two places, not one: the URL in App Store Connect
 * metadata, and a link within the app itself. Only the metadata half existed, and
 * a missing in-app link is a routine 5.1.1 rejection — days of round trip for a
 * text button.
 *
 * It is rendered on the pairing screen as well as in the drawer because the
 * drawer is behind a pairing. A reviewer with no computer running the daemon
 * never gets past the first screen, so a link that lives only in the drawer is,
 * from where the review sits, not in the app at all.
 *
 * Opens in the in-app browser for the same reason message links do: leaving for
 * Safari backgrounds the app, which drops the socket and strands any permission
 * request waiting on an answer.
