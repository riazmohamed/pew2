/**
 * Making sure an agent process never outlives the daemon that spawned it.
 *
 * Two separate leaks, and they need two separate mechanisms.
 *
 * **The wrapper.** Five bundled providers launch through `npx`, so the process
 * this daemon owns is a launcher and the actual agent is its child. Killing the
 * wrapper reparents the agent to pid 1, where nothing will ever collect it.
 * Every child is therefore spawned `detached` on POSIX, which gives it its own
 * process group, and killed by *group* — the wrapper and everything under it.
 * Windows has no process groups and `detached` there means something close to
 * the opposite (a child that outlives its parent by design), so it is never set
 * on win32 and `taskkill /T` walks the tree instead. Same split as Playwright's
 * process launcher, for the same reason.
 *
 * **The hard death.** `closeAll()` on SIGTERM handles an orderly stop, but a
 * daemon killed with SIGKILL, OOM-ed, or lost to a panic runs no handler at
 * all, and its agents survive as orphans holding hundreds of MB each. No signal
 * can fix that from inside the dying process, so instead every spawn is
 * recorded to disk and the *next* daemon sweeps what the last one left: an
 * entry whose owning daemon is gone is an orphan by definition.
 *
 * Pid reuse is the obvious hazard in a registry like this, so a recorded pid is
 * only ever signalled when the identity still on it matches the one recorded at
 * spawn. A stale entry then costs nothing; killing an innocent process that
 * inherited the number would cost a lot. Both sides of that comparison come
 * from the OS rather than the manifest, for the same reason: the manifest says
 * `goose acp` while the kernel says `/opt/homebrew/bin/goose acp`, and matching
 * the manifest text would have quietly spared every orphan it was written for.
