 * The drawer entry for a conversation that has been asked for but does not

 *
 * `session.start` is a request, not a creation: the daemon has to spawn the
 * agent and complete an ACP handshake before it can answer with an id, which
 * takes seconds. Until this module existed the app posted that request and
 * added nothing to the list, on the reasoning that `session.started` would
 * create the entry when it landed. That holds only while the frame lands. Send
 * a prompt that starts a conversation, switch to another one while the agent
 * boots, and the new conversation was in no list at all — still running on the
 * desktop, unreachable from the phone, and only a relaunch brought it back.
 *
 * So the entry is created by the request instead, and the answer adopts it. A
 * conversation the user started is visible from the moment they start it, and
 * the failure modes degrade in the right direction: a lost answer leaves a row
 * that can be cleaned up, rather than work with nowhere to appear.
 *
 * Pure and React-free so the adoption rules are directly testable.
