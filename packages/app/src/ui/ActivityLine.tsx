/**
 * What the agent is doing, right now, in one line.
 *
 * The transcript's footer used to be three fading dots: honest, but it says
 * only "something is happening" for what can be minutes of work on a machine
 * the user cannot see. The agent already reports every tool it calls, so this
 * names the current one instead — and lights it with a travelling gradient,
 * which is what separates "still working" from a line that has stalled.
 *
 * It is deliberately one row at the transcript's left rail, exactly where the
 * reply will begin: the answer lands where the activity was, so nothing shifts
 * when the work turns into text. And it exits the moment the turn is over —
 * `ui/TurnReceipt.tsx` takes its place with what actually happened.
