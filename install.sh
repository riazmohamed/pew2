# Downloads one self-contained binary. No Node, no Bun, no git clone. The
# runtime is compiled into the executable, which is the whole point: someone who
# installed the phone app should not have to set up a development environment.

# Deliberately short and readable. Piping a script from the internet into a
# shell is a real trust ask, and the only honest answer is a script you can read
# in a minute.
#
# The layout is the same vertical rail `pew2 setup` uses, so the two read as one
# product rather than two tools that happen to ship together. Every line hangs
# off the rail at the same column; nothing is indented by eye.
